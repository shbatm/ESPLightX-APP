## Development Notes:
Thank you to Michael Brink and Duality4Y for their contributions to the original [ESPLight](https://esplight.fridgefire.nl/) project.  This project is an expansion of that original idea to allow for more complex animations and colors selections using WS2812B LED strips.

This app was developed using Onsen UI, Angular JS (V1), and Cordova.
